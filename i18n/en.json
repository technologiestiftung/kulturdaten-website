This is a problem especially for smaller cultural actors, who have an exciting offer, but often do not have the financial or human resources to be well represented digitally. With the kulturdaten.berlin platform, we want to radically simplify this process!\n\nThat's why we are developing the first open, digital infrastructure for cultural data in Berlin together with cultural actors, in order to connect information on cultural venues and offerings with numerous portals in a targeted manner.\n\nAnd of course, not only institutions, but also groups, collectives and solo artists in particular can publish their profiles and offerings via kulturdaten.berlin."

			"description": "Itâ€™s not so long ago that most of us used to get information about cultural events mainly from print magazines like Zitty and 030. Today, thatâ€™s almost inconceivable; most of us have been browsing online for suitable cultural highlights for a long time now. And on the one hand, this offers many opportunities to find out about Berlinâ€™s diverse cultural scene, but on the other hand, there is a lack of a central overview of all the cityâ€™s cultural institutions and events.\n\nWith kulturdaten.berlin, we are creating the basis for making it easier to discover the diversity of Berlinâ€™s culture - from nice, small events in the neighborhood to major cultural productions."
