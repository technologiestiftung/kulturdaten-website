Today, that’s almost inconceivable; the Internet and smartphones have taken over. Although the Internet offers many ways to find out about Berlin’s diverse cultural scene, there is still no central overview of all the city’s cultural institutions and events.\n\nWith kulturdaten.berlin, we are creating the basis for making it easier to discover the diversity of Berlin’s culture - from nice, small events in the neighborhood to major cultural productions."
